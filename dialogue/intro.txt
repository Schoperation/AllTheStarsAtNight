B: Alright so earlier this month I was going through old stuff with my dad right? I found an old shooter game from the 80s, box cover and manual and all!
B: Flipping through the pages it had the normal stuff...
B: WASD to move around,
B: Use the mouse to click and interact with things,
B: Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out,
B: Hell you could use Q and E to rotate the board, which was interesting.
V: What was it called?
B: Something blood dark something. It was some adapted board game or something.
V: Hm.
B: By the way where the hell are we? I hope our friend here knows what he's doing. Guess we'll follow him.
