B: You ever been on a boat?
V: The ferry up north yeah.
B: Alright, but not an actual, uh, personal boat? Whatever they're technically called?
V: Nope.
B: Well dang, you're missing out.
V: Eh.
B: Here lemme tell you a story...
B: So about a couple years ago my dad and I took our boat out to the lake... the big one...
V: What big one?
B: Yellow- angle? Lake? Yellow something I didn't catch it.'
V: Yeah Yellowhingle.
B: Ah right. Anyway, my dad looked beyond the horizon a little and noticed a few clouds were starting to bunch up and darken.
B: I said 'Eh we'll be fine let's go.'
B: Lo and behold, 15 minutes later we were blazing across the lake in ice cold, heavy rain.
B: The lake seemingly became choppy as hell immediately. Every 5 minutes we hit a big wave and we'd be forcibly sprayed right in the face.
B: Of course, we were prepared... slightly. We had a poncho. A, poncho. 
B: I got to it first since my dad was at the helm of our itty bitty bathtub we called a boat.
V: Lovely.
B: Though that meant my dad had to brave the wind and water, so props to him.
V: Maybe he needed the poncho more than you did.
B: Probably. But not like he couldn't handle it. Hence why he let me have it.
V: Huh.
B: Anyway back to the story. Once we got onto shore to eat lunch we were completely soaked. 
B: Well, my dad more than I was but it still took me a dang long while to put the dang thing on. 
B: But yeah, remember kids. Pay attention to the weather. But even if you don't, at least you can tell everyone else about it later.
