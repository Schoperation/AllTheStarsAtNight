B: Vigil?
V: ...
B: Hey Vigil?
V: Wha?
B: You ever uh wonder...
B: ..what life's about?
V: Sometimes.
B: Well I don't. At least not all the time.
B: I realized something. Not sure if it matters, but it's interesting enough.
B: I could blabber on all day about, well God knows what, and,
B: ...
V: Hm?
B: That's about it. I mean look at us. We're about to leave high school and I have no clue on what to do.
V: Ah. Yeah.
B: Do you know?
V: Not quite, but I am planning to go to community.
B: Did you get in?
V: Yep.
B: Dang, nice. Would be nice if I had that kind of certainty.
V: Me too.
B: Do you know what you're gonna study?
V: Like I said, not quite, but maybe something in media.
B: Media?
V: TV, newspaper, or perhaps a website.
B: Like journalism or... anchorman?
V: I guess journalism. As long as I can write.
B: Fair enough. You seem good at listening. Considering you rarely interrupt me through my stuff.
V: Mhm. It's more than listening but yeah.
B: Should be good. Good luck I suppose.
V: Yeah you too.
B: Thanks.
