B: So this one guy in my troop, right?
V: What?
B: You know, my scout troop.
V: Ok, who?
B: I don't know his name, and neither does anyone else,
B: BUT, he's pretty weird.
B: In a cool way, not weird weird.
V: Uh huh...
B: Alright alright so apparently, he's obsessed with ham radio.
B: When he first mentioned that no one knew what the hell he was talking about.
B: I thought it was some station that he really liked but NO!
B: One day he brought in an actual, fricking, radio and said 'Alright guys wanna talk to someone in Switzerland?' Well I think it was Switzerland, or Swaziland? Some land place.
V: Probably the first one.
B: Anyway, we all said sure because we were still waiting around for the adults and such right,
B: He fired it up, said... God knows what, something alpha charlie golf? Some numbers and stuff I guess it was his identification or what-not.
B: And lo and behold! We got a signal from his buddy from all across the Atlantic. He kinda sounded European so that's how I knew it wasn't even a sham. 
B: Well, maybe he was in an outhouse behind us but still... I believed him.
B: We then took turns just talking to the guy and screwing with the radio... I wanted to be uh, a little more hands on and started turning knobs.
B: Turns out, it's not like the movies; none of the cool sound effects, so I did them myself.
B: Waaahhh weeeeeeaaaaaahhhhhhhh ooohhhh WAAAAAAAHHH
V: Um, please, um, could you...
B: Sorry, anyway yeah, it was cool.
